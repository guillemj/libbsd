.Sh NAME
.Nm explicit_bzero
.Nd write zeroes to a byte string
.Sh LIBRARY
.ds str-Lb-libbsd Utility functions from BSD systems (libbsd, \-lbsd)

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
(See
.Xr libbsd 7
for include usage.)
.Ft void
.Fn explicit_bzero "void *buf" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn explicit_bzero
function writes
.Fa len
zero bytes to the string
.Fa buf .
If
.Fa len
is zero,
.Fn explicit_bzero
does nothing.
.Pp
The
.Fn explicit_bzero
variant behaves the same as the
.Fn bzero
function, but will not be removed by a compiler's dead store optimization
pass, making it useful for clearing sensitive memory such as a password.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bzero 3 ,
.Xr memset 3 ,
.Xr swab 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn explicit_bzero
function first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 ,
glibc 2.25.
