.Sh NAME
.Nm libbsd
.Nd utility functions from BSD systems
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm libbsd
library provides a set of compatibility macros and functions commonly found
on BSD-based systems.
Its purpose is to make those available on non-BSD based systems to ease
portability.
.Pp
The library can be used in an overlay mode, which is the preferred way, so
that the code is portable and requires no modification to the original BSD
code.
This can be done easily with the
.Xr pkg-config 3
library named
.Pa libbsd-overlay .
Or by adding the system-specific include directory with the
.Pa bsd/
suffix to the list of system include paths.
With
.Nm gcc
this could be
.Ar -isystem ${includedir}/bsd .
In addition the
.Dv LIBBSD_OVERLAY
pre-processor variable needs to be defined.
The includes in this case should be the usual system ones, such as
.In unistd.h .
.Pp
The other way to use the library is to use the namespaced headers,
this is less portable as it makes using
.Nm libbsd
mandatory and it will not work on BSD-based systems, and requires
modifying original BSD code.
This can be done with the
.Xr pkg-config 3
library named
.Pa libbsd .
The includes in this case should be namespaced with
.Pa bsd/ ,
such as
.In bsd/unistd.h .
.Pp
The package also provides a
.Pa bsd-ctor
static library that can be used to inject automatic constructors into a
program so that the
.Fn setproctitle_init
function gets invoked automatically at startup time.
This can be done with the
.Xr pkg-config 3
library named
.Pa libbsd-ctor .
.Sh HEADERS
The following are the headers provided by
.Nm libbsd ,
that extend the standard system headers.
They can work in normal or overlay modes, for the former they need to
be prefixed with
.Pa bsd/ .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4m -compact
.It In bitstring.h
.It In err.h
.It In getopt.h
.It In inttypes.h

.El
.Pp
The following is a
.Pa libbsd
specific convenience header, that includes some of the extended headers.
It only works in non-overlay mode.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4m -compact
.It In bsd/bsd.h
.El
.Sh DEPRECATED
Some functions have been deprecated, they will emit warnings at compile time
and possibly while being linked at run-time.
This might be due to the functions not being portable at all to other
systems, making the package not buildable there; not portable in a correct
or non-buggy way; or because there are better more portable replacements now.
.Pp
This is the list of currently deprecated macros and functions:
.Bl -tag -width 4m
.It Fn fgetln
Unportable, requires assistance from the stdio layer.
An implementation has to choose between leaking buffers or being reentrant
for a limited amount of streams (this implementation chose the latter with
a limit of 32).
Use
.Fn getline 3
instead, which is available in many systems and required by
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.It Fn fgetwln
Unportable, requires assistance from the stdio layer.
An implementation has to choose between leaking buffers or being reentrant
for a limited amount of streams (this implementation chose the latter with
a limit of 32).
Use
.Fn fgetwc 3
instead, which is available in many systems and required by
.St -isoC-99
and
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.It Fn funopen
Unportable, requires assistance from the stdio layer or some hook framework.
On GNU systems the
.Fn fopencookie
function can be used.
Otherwise the code needs to be prepared for neither of these functions being
available.
.El
.Sh SUPERSEDED
Some functions have been superseded by implementations in other system
libraries, and might disappear on the next SONAME bump, assuming those
other implementation have widespread deployment, or the implementations
are present in all major
.Nm libc
for example.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 4m -compact
.It Fn MD5Init
.It Fn MD5Update
.It Fn MD5Pad
.It Fn MD5Final
.It Fn MD5Transform
.It Fn MD5End
.It Fn MD5File
.It Fn MD5FileChunk
.It Fn MD5Data
The set of MD5 digest functions are now provided by the
.Nm libmd
companion library, so it is advised to use that instead.
.It Fn explicit_bzero
This function is provided by
.Nm glibc
2.25.
.It Fn reallocarray
This function is provided by
.Nm glibc
2.26.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm libbsd
project started in the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port as a way to ease porting
code from FreeBSD to the GNU-based system.
Pretty early on it was generalized and a project created on FreeDesktop.org
for other distributions and projects to use.
.Pp
It is now distributed as part of most non-BSD distributions.
